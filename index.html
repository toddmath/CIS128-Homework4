    <h4>About PWA's:</h4>
    <p>Progressive web apps, or <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA's</abbr>, are a major step forward
      in helping make the modern web environment more progressive, both for developers and users alike.
      There are a few security advantages in regards to <abbr>PWA's</abbr>, as well as performance enhancements.
    </p>
    <p>When developing a PWA, I reccomend testing it inside of Chrome, as it's
      <code>chrome://serviceworker-internals</code> page is very useful for detailed information in regards to
      all service worker state's.
      Another chrome page that's helpful is <code>chrome://inspect/#service-workers</code>. It allows you to see
      registered service workers, and inspect them if desired.
      Not only does it give verbose information, it also allows some control over the service worker thru a
      register/unregister button and a start/stop button, as well.</p>
    <p>One of the major advantages gained with PWA's is reliability. No matter the network state of the client,
      loading is instant because of it's use of service workers.
      The service worker ensures that all necessary resources are cached inside the client's memory, ready to
      answer requests whether online or offline!</p>
    <p>Another advantage gained by developing a PWA is security. In order to qualify as a PWA, your app must use
      the strictest security standards including HTTPS and HTTP/2.
      Not only does this secure the server, it also gives customers and clients piece of mind. Studies prove
      this piece of mind translates into more sales and profits for the site owners.
